  <p>
    My name is <strong>Dainan Caywood</strong>. I am a storm chaser,
    photographer, and weather systems developer focused on documenting
    severe weather across the United States.
  </p>

  <p>
    My interests include supercell structure, tornado dynamics,
    radar visualization, and atmospheric field observation.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the field, I combine forecasting analysis with
    high-resolution photography to capture both the science
    and intensity of severe weather events.
