      <h1>About STRATUS</h1>
      <p>
        STRATUS (Storm Tracking, Research, And Targeted U.S. Studies) is a collaborative field research program dedicated to improving understanding of 
        severe weather and its impacts on the environment and communities across the United States.
      </p>

      <p>
      STRATUS brings together researchers, students, and atmospheric scientists to collect, analyze, and share in-situ meteorological data obtained through mobile field 
        operations and deployable instrumentation. Our work emphasizes storm-scale observations, boundary-layer processes, and near-surface atmospheric 
        behavior that are often difficult to capture through remote sensing alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through ongoing collaboration with universities, government agencies, and private institutions, STRATUS supports scientific advancement while fostering 
        innovation in environmental monitoring technologies and applied impact research, including emergency management and agricultural applications.
      </p>
