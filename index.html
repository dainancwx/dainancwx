      <h1>Welcome to STRATUS</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>STRATUS™ (Storm Tracking, Research, And Targeted U.S. Studies) is a storm-scale atmospheric field research program 
          focused on collecting in-situ data within severe weather systems.
      </p>

      <p>
       Our mission is to bridge the gap between meteorological theory and real-world conditions by deploying field-ready instrumentation directly 
        into storms and providing open-access datasets for researchers, emergency management, and applied impact studies. 
        STRATUS teams design and operate advanced sensor arrays, mobile weather platforms, and experimental probes to investigate mesocyclone behavior, 
        near-surface wind structure, and storm–environment interactions.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Focus Areas</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>🔬 Experimental field deployments and instrument testing within severe convective storms</li>
        <li>🌪️ In-situ storm research, including mesocyclone structure, near-surface winds, and boundary-layer processes</li>
        <li>🌾 Applied impact studies, examining how severe weather affects agriculture, infrastructure, and the local environment</li>
        <li>🛰️ High-resolution data collection using mobile mesonets, fixed stations, and deployable probe systems</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Get Involved</h2>
      <p>
        STRATUS is open to research collaboration, instrument testing partnerships, 
        and data-sharing initiatives. We welcome collaboration with universities, government agencies, private research groups, 
        and independent scientists interested in advancing storm-scale field research.
